Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial plans for its clients. They hired us to create their open-source web application and make it secure enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained therein. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did a good job using static testing to find the current vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is crucial to preventing data theft and preserving the company's integrity and dependability reputation.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Something I found challenging during the vulnerability assessment was working with supressing the file.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Penetration testing should be necessary in the future to more accurately identify vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
If new dependencies were added, the dependency check had to be re-run. Otherwise, functionality can be ensured through manual code review and unit testing. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found it very helpful to use the Internet to research current procedures and algorithms.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In order to demonstrate to a prospective employer that I am skilled at identifying vulnerabilities within a codebase, I might think about using Dependency checkers.
